Project built using a ReactJS frontend, Spring backend, and an AWS S3 bucket.

This is a demo project to showcase my current and improving knowledge using Spring as a backend for web applications, as well as a foray into using the AWS Java SDK for accessing AWS Services.

The project manages dependencies in `gradle.build` and is run from `src/main`

The `src/main` folder has two folders, 
- `frontend`: contains a ReactJS client side interface
- `java/com/...`: contains the Spring Application written in an MVC fashion.
